### The following directives do not change with server reload.

# User authentication method. To require multiple methods to be
# used for the user to login, add multiple auth directives. The values
# in the 'auth' directive are AND composed (if multiple all must
# succeed).
# Available options: certificate, plain, pam, radius, gssapi.
# Note that authentication methods utilizing passwords cannot be
# combined (e.g., the plain, pam or radius methods).

# certificate:
#  This indicates that all connecting users must present a certificate.
#  The username and user group will be then extracted from it (see
#  cert-user-oid and cert-group-oid). The certificate to be accepted
#  it must be signed by the CA certificate as specified in 'ca-cert' and
#  it must not be listed in the CRL, as specified by the 'crl' option.
#
# pam[gid-min=1000]:
#  This enabled PAM authentication of the user. The gid-min option is used
# by auto-select-group option, in order to select the minimum valid group ID.
#
# plain[passwd=/etc/ocserv/ocpasswd,otp=/etc/ocserv/users.otp]
#  The plain option requires specifying a password file which contains
# entries of the following format.
# "username:groupname1,groupname2:encoded-password"
# One entry must be listed per line, and 'ocpasswd' should be used
# to generate password entries. The 'otp' suboption allows one to specify
# an oath password file to be used for one time passwords; the format of
# the file is described in https://github.com/archiecobbs/mod-authn-otp/wiki/UsersFile
#
# radius[config=/etc/radiusclient/radiusclient.conf,groupconfig=true,nas-identifier=name]:
#  The radius option requires specifying freeradius-client configuration
# file. If the groupconfig option is set, then config-per-user/group will be overridden,
# and all configuration will be read from radius. That also includes the
# Acct-Interim-Interval, and Session-Timeout values.
#
# See doc/README-radius.md for the supported radius configuration atributes.
#
# gssapi[keytab=/etc/key.tab,require-local-user-map=true,tgt-freshness-time=900]
#  The gssapi option allows one to use authentication methods supported by GSSAPI,
# such as Kerberos tickets with ocserv. It should be best used as an alternative
# to PAM (i.e., have pam in auth and gssapi in enable-auth), to allow users with
# tickets and without tickets to login. The default value for require-local-user-map
# is true. The 'tgt-freshness-time' if set, it would require the TGT tickets presented
# to have been issued within the provided number of seconds. That option is used to
# restrict logins even if the KDC provides long time TGT tickets.

# succeeding allows login).

# Accounting methods available:
# radius: can be combined with any authentication method, it provides
#      radius accounting to available users (see also stats-report-time).
#
# pam: can be combined with any authentication method, it provides
#      a validation of the connecting user's name using PAM. It is
#      superfluous to use this method when authentication is already
#      PAM.

# This option allows you to specify a URL location where a client can
# post using MS-KKDCP, and the message will be forwarded to the provided
# KDC server. That is a translation URL between HTTP and Kerberos.
# In MIT kerberos you'll need to add in realms:
#   EXAMPLE.COM = {
#     kdc = https://ocserv.example.com/KdcProxy
#     http_anchors = FILE:/etc/ocserv-ca.pem
#   }
# In some distributions the krb5-k5tls plugin of kinit is required.
#
# The following option is available in ocserv, when compiled with GSSAPI support. 

#kkdcp = "SERVER-PATH KERBEROS-REALM PROTOCOL@SERVER:PORT"
#kkdcp = "/KdcProxy KERBEROS.REALM udp@127.0.0.1:88"

#kkdcp = "/KdcProxy KERBEROS.REALM tcp@[::1]:88"

# Client profile xml. This can be used to advertise alternative servers
# to the client. A minimal file can be:
# <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
# <AnyConnectProfile xmlns="http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/encoding/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/encoding/ AnyConnectProfile.xsd">
#	<ServerList>
#		<HostEntry>
#	            <HostName>VPN Server name</HostName>
#	            <HostAddress>localhost</HostAddress>

# This file must be accessible from inside the worker's chroot. 
# Note that:
#  (1) enabling this option is not recommended as it will allow the
#      worker processes to open arbitrary files (when isolate-workers is
#      set to true).
#  (2) This option cannot be set per-user or per-group; only the global
#      version is being sent to client.

#
# The following options are for (experimental) AnyConnect client 
# compatibility. 

# This option will enable the pre-draft-DTLS version of DTLS, and
# will not require clients to present their certificate on every TLS
# connection. It must be set to true to support legacy CISCO clients
# and openconnect clients < 7.08. When set to true, it implies dtls-legacy = true.
cisco-client-compat = true

# This option allows one to disable the DTLS-PSK negotiation (enabled by default).
# The DTLS-PSK negotiation was introduced in ocserv 0.11.5 to deprecate
# the pre-draft-DTLS negotiation inherited from AnyConnect. It allows the
# DTLS channel to negotiate its ciphers and the DTLS protocol version.
#dtls-psk = false

# This option allows one to disable the legacy DTLS negotiation (enabled by default,
# but that may change in the future).
# The legacy DTLS uses a pre-draft version of the DTLS protocol and was
# from AnyConnect protocol. It has several limitations, that are addressed
# by the dtls-psk protocol supported by openconnect 7.08+.
dtls-legacy = true

#Advanced options

# Option to allow sending arbitrary custom headers to the client after
# authentication and prior to VPN tunnel establishment. You shouldn't
# need to use this option normally; if you do and you think that
# this may help others, please send your settings and reason to
# the openconnect mailing list. The special keywords '%{U}'
# and '%{G}', if present will be replaced by the username and group name.
